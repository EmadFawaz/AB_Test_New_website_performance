## Hypothesis testing and regression using Python3


## Aim of the Project

This project was part of my Data Analyst Nano Degree @ Udacity. This project aims to assure that I have mastered hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and various related statistical concepts. 

## Introduction

This project aims at understanding the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website.  The goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
The project includes basic statistics, hypothesis formulation and testing, and regression analysis. Some machine learning techniques, such as bootstrapping, were utilized in hypothesis testing. Packages such as pandas, numpy and matplotlib were used. Finding and conclusions are discussed within the programming file. 


## Contribution
As this is a learning experience for me, I do expect that there might be enhancement and simplification to my code. Please feel free to share with me your insights. It will be extremely appreciated.
